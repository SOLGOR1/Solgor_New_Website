We will launch a Solgor Avatar NFT Collection consisting of 6900 pieces at a mint price of 0.069 SOL. The Solana earned from this collection will fund the initial plans of the Solgor Community. The more NFTs minted, the quicker we will adopt a gorilla and strengthen the Burn Mechanism, benefiting all $GOR holders.

## Mint Process

The minting page on our website will go live on Friday. From 8:00 PM onwards, anyone wishing to support Solgor can mint.

### Steps:

1. **Prepare:** Get a Solana Wallet ([Phantom](https://phantom.app/), [Solflare](https://solflare.com/)).
2. **Deposit:** Send Solana to your wallet.
3. **Connect:** On our website, go to "Mint" and connect your wallet.
4. **Mint:** Choose the quantity and click on Mint.

## Gorilla Adoption Process

The team has decided that the proceeds from the first 100 mints will be used to fund a gorilla adoption. The official adoption certificate and photos of our adopted gorilla will be published on the website.

The remaining proceeds will be used for the Burn Mechanism.

## Burn Mechanism

We've carefully crafted a sustainable Burn Mechanism, aiming for continuous burning rather than a one-time event. Instead of simply burning all remaining proceeds, we will create two pools that generate revenue for consistent burning.

### Pools:

#### SOL/USDC
- 1% Fee

#### SOL/GOR
- 1% Fee

These pools generate revenue from trades between Solana and USDC, and Solana and $GOR. We will use these earnings to buy back GOR from the market every month, burning them to reduce the total supply and increase value for all token holders.

## Why Two Pools?

In case of low volume or activity in the SOL/GOR pool, the SOL/USDC pool will ensure continuous burning.

## Future Plans

If all NFTs are minted, we plan to introduce a third pool in partnership with Oinkhunter.

### Pool:

#### GOR/HUNT
- 1% Fee

We extend a heartfelt thank you to all holders and supporters of the project. Together, we can achieve even more!
