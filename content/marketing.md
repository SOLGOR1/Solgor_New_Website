# Community Announcement: Join Our NFT Funding Round Marketing Campaign!

Dear Community,

We are thrilled to announce our upcoming NFT funding round, which promises to be a game-changer in the world of digital assets. As we gear up for this exciting venture, we are reaching out to you, our talented community, to help us spread the word and make this initiative a resounding success.

Here's a brief overview of what we have in store: 
- Our NFT funding round will feature a total of 6900 unique tokens priced at 0.069 SOL each.
- With a marketing budget of 3 SOL at our disposal, we recognize the need to ensure fair distribution of resources among our dedicated promoters.

Given the overwhelming interest from numerous individuals eager to promote our NFT funding round, we understand the importance of devising a fair and transparent system for allocating marketing rewards. After careful consideration, we have come up with a strategy that we believe aligns with our goals and values.

Starting this Friday at 20:00 UTC, we will kick off our marketing campaign, during which each promoter will have the opportunity to showcase their skills and reach. We will track the performance of each promotional effort, particularly focusing on the reach achieved by each post or promotion. **Attention:** Use the Hashtag #SolgorNFT in your post to be eligible.

At the end of the campaign, on Sunday, March 31, we will distribute the marketing rewards as follows:

- The post with the highest reach will receive 1 SOL.
- The second-highest reaching post will receive 0.5 SOL.
- 15 promoters, depending on the reach, who actively participate and contribute to the campaign will receive 0.1 SOL each.

We believe that this approach not only incentivizes creativity and dedication but also ensures that our marketing budget is utilized effectively to maximize exposure for our NFT funding round.

We are confident that with your expertise and enthusiasm, we can make this marketing campaign a resounding success. Thank you for your ongoing support and commitment to our vision.

And don't forget to add the Hashtag #SolgorNFT!
