[Mint](https://www.launchmynft.io/collections/HtHgngcma1oYDiiBo7w7LswpcTSUDrgw7QvMsEhFnw9b/hNgE5uKGd9xaRNw93rk7)

We will launch a Solgor Avatar NFT Collection consisting of: 
- 6900 pieces 
- at a mint price of 0.069 SOL

The Solana earned from this collection will fund the initial plans of the Solgor Community. 
###### The more NFTs minted, the quicker we will adopt a gorilla and strengthen the Burn Mechanism, benefiting all $GOR holders.

## Gorilla Adoption Process

The team has decided that the proceeds from the first 100 mints will be used to fund a gorilla adoption. 
The official adoption certificate and photos of our adopted gorilla will be published on the website.

The remaining proceeds will be used for the Burn Mechanism.

## Burn Mechanism

We've carefully crafted a sustainable Burn Mechanism, aiming for continuous burning rather than a one-time event. 
Instead of simply burning all remaining proceeds, we will create two pools that generate revenue for consistent burning.

### Pools:
<Tabs>

<Tab name="SOL/USDC">

#### SOLANA - USDC
1% Fee
This pool generates revenue from trades between Solana and USDC
</Tab>

<Tab name="SOL/GOR">

#### SOLANA - SOLGOR
1% Fee
This pool generates revenue from trades between Solana and Solgor
</Tab>

</Tabs>

These pools generate revenue from trades between Solana and USDC, and Solana and Solgor. 

###### We will use these earnings to buy back GOR from the market every month, burning them to reduce the total supply and increase value for all token holders.

<Accordion title="Why Two Pools?">
In case of low volume or activity in the SOL/GOR pool, the SOL/USDC pool will ensure continuous burning.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if all NFTs get Minted?">
If all NFTs are minted, we plan to introduce a third pool in partnership with Oinkhunter.
#### GOR/HUNT
- 1% Fee
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is purchasing GOR required for NFT minting?">
No, minting will exclusively utilize Solana SOL.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the minting price?">
The minting price is set at 0.069 SOL.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is there a limit to the number of NFTs I can mint?">
No, you can mint as many NFTs as desired.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When is the first burn scheduled?">
The first burn event is slated for April 30, 2024.
